# My Thai Star

This repository is an **iCSD Capgemini** initiative that hosts an application reference called **My Thai Star**. This application is about the management of a restaurant.

## Technologies

This project is intended to be an example for the usage of  new technologies in web development. Here is a list of all technologies involved:

* **Angular**

Client-side developed using the latest version of this framework: Angular 4.


* **Java**

Server-side developed using the 2.3 version of **oasp4j**.

* **NodeJS**

Server-side developed using the basics of the Express framework. Progressively updated to use **oasp4fn**.

* **.NET**

Server-side developed using the **dotnet** framework.

* **Swagger**

Used this technology to define contracts between client-side(s) and server-side(s). So necessary when every back-end of the project (.NET, NodeJS and Java) is prepared to match with the Angular client exactly in the same way, being transparent to the user.

* **Production Line**

Tool used for Continuous Integration and Continious Delivery. Inside of this Jenkins and SonarQube are used. Also used **Docker** for the deployment in an external server.

* **GraphQL**

GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system definen for data.
